While it performs better than prior versions like GPT-3.5, it is still not fully reliable [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n2. **Knowledge Cutoff Date**: Its training data primarily includes information up until September 2021. As a result, GPT-4 lacks knowledge of events or developments that occurred after this date, which can lead to outdated or irrelevant answers [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n3. **Overconfidence**: GPT-4 can confidently provide incorrect answers, sometimes failing to double-check or validate its responses, especially in subtle or complex tasks [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n4. **Reasoning and Problem Solving**: It can fail on challenging problems, introduce errors such as security vulnerabilities in generated code, and display gullibility by accepting and responding to obviously false user statements [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n5. **Bias and Disinformation**: Like other AI models, GPT-4 may retain biases present in training data and could propagate disinformation if not carefully constrained [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n\n6. **Context Limitations**: GPT-4 requires user-supplied context when operating in specialized or detailed scenarios, as it doesn’t inherently \"learn\" or retain information across sessions [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\nCareful application and critical review are necessary when relying on GPT-4 for tasks, particularly those where accuracy is critical.", "context": "GPT-4 Technical Report - Page 2: Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \"hallucinations\"), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience.

{"query": "How does GPT-4's performance scale with compute?", "response": "GPT-4's performance scales predictably with compute, following power law relationships often observed in large language models. When training compute increases, the model's final loss tends to reduce predictably, which is vital for making informed decisions about alignment, safety, and deployment before training on large scales.\n\nFor example:\n1. **Loss Prediction:** GPT-4's final loss on its codebase was accurately predicted by fitting a scaling law based on models trained with 1,000x to 10,000x less compute [see doc_0] (doc_0) [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n2. **Capabilities Scaling:** Improvements in tasks such as pass rates on datasets (e.g., HumanEval for coding) also scale predictably with compute. A power law relationship effectively predicted performance metrics from much smaller scale models [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n\nThese predictable scaling properties indicate that smaller, computationally cheaper models can aid in estimating the capabilities and behaviors of much larger systems before full-scale training.", "context": "GPT-4 Technical Report - Predictable Scaling: A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably...

You can train a custom extraction model by labeling as few as five example documents. This type of model is ideal for forms and documents that require AI to understand and extract structured data from specific fields [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n\n2. **Composed Custom Models**: By grouping multiple custom models into one, composed models enable efficient document analysis. They automatically classify and utilize the most appropriate custom model to process a given document type. For example, you might combine models trained to recognize supply, equipment, and furniture purchase orders into a single composed model, simplifying document processing workflows [see doc_0] (doc_0).\n\nEach of these models is trained on your specific forms or datasets, allowing for highly personalized results tailored to your business needs.
