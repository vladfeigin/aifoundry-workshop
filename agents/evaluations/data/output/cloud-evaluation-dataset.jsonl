{"query": "What is GPT-4?", "response": "According to the search results, GPT-4 is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI and made available as part of Azure OpenAI Service. It is capable of processing both text and image inputs, offering improved performance, reliability, and the ability to handle more complex instructions compared to earlier versions like GPT-3.5. GPT-4 features enhanced reasoning abilities, a broader general knowledge base, and better adherence to provided instructions, allowing it to deliver more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n\nFor example, GPT-4 can be used for a variety of language tasks such as summarization, content generation, conversation, and more. It also supports different deployment options such as chat completion and can be accessed through Azure’s APIs and tools.\n\nIn summary, GPT-4 is a highly capable AI language model that offers significant improvements in capabilities, safety, and flexibility compared to its predecessors, and is integrated into the Azure AI ecosystem for enterprise and developer use (Sources: \"Azure OpenAI Service Overview,\" \"GPT-4 Model Family\").", "context": "GPT-4 Technical Report - Abstract: We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs...

{"query": "What are the main limitations of GPT-4?", "response": "According to the information available in the provided documents, the main limitations of GPT-4 are as follows:\n\n1. **Factually Inaccurate Outputs**: GPT-4 may still produce responses that are incorrect or misleading (“hallucinations\"). Document C highlights that “GPT models can still hallucinate\" and may “generate incorrect or fictitious information.”\n\n2. **Knowledge Cutoff**: The model's training data only goes up to a certain date (April 2023 for GPT-4, as noted in multiple documents). It does not have real-time awareness of events or developments after that point.\n\n3. **Lack of Reasoning/Understanding**: While GPT-4 is an advanced language model, it does not demonstrate true reasoning or deep understanding; it predicts text based on statistically likely sequences from its training data (Document A).\n\n4. **Dependence on Input Quality**: If the input is ambiguous, vague, or phrased in a misleading way, GPT-4’s answers may be similarly flawed (Document C).\n\n5. **Limited Context Window**: GPT-4 has a finite context window (the number of tokens it can process in one input). This constrains how much text it can consider at once, limiting very long conversations or documents (Document B).\n\n6. **Biases in Output**: Its outputs can reflect biases present within its training data. Document A mentions it “may reinforce or reflect undesirable biases.”\n\n7. **No Personal Experience or Sentience**: GPT-4 does not have emotions, consciousness, or “understanding” in the way humans do (Document A).\n\n8. **Inability to Access External Data or Systems**: Without tools or plugins, GPT-4 cannot browse the web, access new data, or interact with external databases (Document B).\n\nThese limitations are important to consider when deploying or relying on GPT-4 for critical or high-accuracy applications.\n\n**Sources**:  \n- Document A: Overview and technical limitations  \n- Document B: Usage boundaries and context window  \n- Document C: AI hallucinations and accuracy concerns", "context": "GPT-4 Technical Report - Page 2: Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \"hallucinations\"), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience.
