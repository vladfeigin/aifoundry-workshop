While it is an improvement over earlier GPT versions in reducing such hallucinations, it still requires careful evaluation, particularly in high-stakes scenarios [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n2. **Knowledge Cut-off**: Its knowledge base is predominantly limited to data collected up to September 2021, although minor updates with more recent data may exist. This means it lacks understanding of events or developments after this period [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n3. **Reasoning Errors**: Despite its competence across various domains, GPT-4 sometimes makes simple yet avoidable reasoning errors. It can also be overly trusting of false statements given by users [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n4. **Overconfidence in Mistakes**: The model can be confidently wrong, making errors in predictions or outputs without thoroughly double-checking its work. This presents risks in applications requiring precision [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n5. **Human-like Failures in Coding**: While highly capable in generating code, it may introduce security vulnerabilities or other errors in produced code, similar to human errors [see doc_2] (doc_2).\n\n6. **Biases and Misuse Risks**: Like earlier LLMs, GPT-4 is susceptible to biases in its training data, which can manifest in its outputs. Its improved capabilities also enhance the potential for misuse, such as proliferating disinformation [see doc_0] (doc_0) [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n\nThese limitations indicate the importance of implementing human review, grounding outputs with additional context, and carefully tailoring system usage to specific applications."}

Predictive models accurately estimated GPT-4's final loss without relying on intermediate training results [see doc_0] (doc_0).\n\n2. **Capability Projections**: In addition to loss prediction, GPT-4 employed methodologies to predict model capabilities, such as the pass rate on the HumanEval dataset, which tests Python function synthesis. Accurate predictions of GPT-4's performance were also derived from scaled-down versions of the model using less compute. The relationship between performance improvement and compute exhibited an approximate power law [see doc_0] (doc_0) [see doc_1] (doc_1).\n\nThis scalable behavior demonstrates that properly optimized large language model pipelines can predict improvements from increased compute with high accuracy, minimizing the need for extensive tuning of individual deployments."}
