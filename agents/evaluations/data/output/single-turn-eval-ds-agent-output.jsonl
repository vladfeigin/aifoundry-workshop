If the context exceeds this window, earlier information may be forgotten (document 3 mentions expanded windows, but there’s still a finite limit).\n\n5. **Limited Domain Expertise:**  \n   While GPT-4 is impressive in general language tasks, it may lack deep expertise or accuracy in specialized professional or technical domains, sometimes misunderstanding complex questions (document 1).\n\n6. **No Reasoning or Understanding:**  \n   The model generates responses based on statistical patterns, not true comprehension or reasoning, which can result in plausible-sounding but incorrect answers (document 2).\n\n**References:**\n- Document 1: GPT-4 main technical report (knowledge cut-off, limited expertise)\n- Document 2: OpenAI Guide for GPT-4 (hallucination, bias, lack of reasoning)\n- Document 3: Azure OpenAI Service documentation (context window limits)\n\nIf you need more specific detail on any of these limitations, please let me know!"}
