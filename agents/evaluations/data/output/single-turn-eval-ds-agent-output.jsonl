{"query": "What are the main limitations of GPT-4?", "context": "GPT-4 Technical Report - Page 2: Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \"hallucinations\"), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.", "ground_truth": "GPT-4's main limitations include: it is not fully reliable and can suffer from hallucinations, has a limited context window, does not learn from experience, and requires careful consideration when used in contexts where reliability is critical.", "agent_response": "The main limitations of GPT-4, as described in the provided documents, are as follows:\n\n1. **Reliability and Hallucinations**  \n   GPT-4 is not fully reliable and can \"hallucinate\" facts or make reasoning errors. This means it may generate information that is incorrect or fabricated, even though it sounds plausible. This limitation is shared with earlier GPT models (Document 2; Document 1).\n\n2. **Reasoning Errors and Overconfidence**  \n   The model can make simple reasoning mistakes that do not align with its otherwise strong performance across many domains. It can also be confidently wrong, sometimes failing to double-check its work or being overly gullible when presented with obviously false statements (Document 2).\n\n3. **Limited Knowledge of Recent Events**  \n   GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its pre-training data, which cuts off in September 2021. While there is a small amount of more recent data, its knowledge is largely outdated beyond that point (Document 2).\n\n4. **No Learning from Experience**  \n   GPT-4 does not learn from its interactions or experiences after its initial training. It cannot update its knowledge or improve its performance based on new information unless it is retrained (Document 2; Document 3).\n\n5. **Context Window Limitations**  \n   Like previous models, GPT-4 has a limited context window, meaning it can only consider a certain amount of text at once when generating responses (Document 1).\n\n6. **Potential for Bias, Disinformation, and Other Risks**  \n   The model can exhibit biases, generate disinformation, and pose risks related to over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, and proliferation. These risks are discussed in more detail in the system card accompanying the technical report (Document 3).\n\n7. **Vulnerabilities in Code Generation**  \n   GPT-4 can introduce security vulnerabilities into code it produces, similar to mistakes made by humans (Document 2).\n\n8. **Need for Human Oversight**  \n   Due to these limitations, outputs from GPT-4 should be carefully reviewed, especially in high-stakes contexts. Protocols such as human review or grounding with additional context are recommended (Document 2).\n\n**Summary:**  \nWhile GPT-4 shows significant improvements over previous models, especially in reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy, it still suffers from unreliability, limited up-to-date knowledge, inability to learn from new experiences, context window constraints, and risks related to bias and misinformation. Human oversight remains essential when using GPT-4, particularly in critical applications.\n\n**References:**  \n- Document 1 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_1_c283f97f)  \n- Document 2 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_10_bbc3e8e4)  \n- Document 3 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_2_1a6d069f)"}

OpenAI successfully predicted GPT-4's final performance by extrapolating from models trained with 1,000x to 10,000x less compute, enabling accurate performance predictions before training completion.", "agent_response": "GPT-4’s performance scales with compute in a predictable and quantifiable way, following power law relationships observed in large language models.\n\n**Key Points from the Documents:**\n\n1. **Predictable Scaling Infrastructure:**  \n   The GPT-4 project focused on building deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed the team to reliably predict aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on smaller models trained with 1,000x to 10,000x less compute (Document 1, Document 2).\n\n2. **Power Law Relationship:**  \n   The final loss of properly-trained large language models, including GPT-4, is well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used for training. Specifically, the loss L(C) can be modeled as L(C) = aCb + c, where C is the compute used (Document 1).\n\n3. **Empirical Validation:**  \n   - The team predicted GPT-4’s final loss on an internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law to smaller models. This prediction, made early in the training process, matched GPT-4’s actual final loss with high accuracy (Document 1, Document 3).\n   - For capability metrics, such as the pass rate on the HumanEval dataset (which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions), performance also followed an approximate power law relationship with compute. Predictions based on smaller models accurately forecasted GPT-4’s performance (Document 1, Document 3).\n\n4. **Figures and Results:**  \n   - Figure 1 (Document 3) shows that the final loss on a code prediction task decreases smoothly as compute increases, following the predicted power law.\n   - Figure 2 (Document 3) demonstrates that the mean log pass rate on coding problems increases with compute, again matching the power law extrapolation from smaller models.\n\n5. **Generalization:**  \n   While performance generally improves with more compute, there can be occasional exceptions for individual tasks, but the overall trend is reliably upward (Document 1).\n\n**Summary:**  \nGPT-4’s performance improves predictably as training compute increases, following power law relationships for both loss and capability metrics. This scaling behavior allows researchers to forecast the performance of large models like GPT-4 using results from much smaller models, making the development process more efficient and reliable.\n\n**References:**  \n- Document 1 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_2_1a6d069f)  \n- Document 2 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_1_c283f97f)  \n- Document 3 (GPT-4-Technical-Report_page_3_2ddddc78)"}

Here are the key safety measures based on the provided context:\n\n**1. Model-Level Mitigations:**\n- **Dataset Filtering:** During pre-training, OpenAI filtered the dataset to reduce the amount of inappropriate erotic text content. This was achieved using a combination of internally trained classifiers and a lexicon-based approach to identify and remove documents likely to contain such content (Document 1).\n- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** After pre-training, OpenAI used RLHF to shape GPT-4’s behavior. This involved collecting demonstration data (showing how the model should respond) and ranking data (ranking outputs from best to worst) from human trainers. These data were used to retrain the model to be safer, such as refusing harmful requests (Document 1).\n- **Annotator Guidelines and Worker Safety:** OpenAI followed industry best practices for annotators, including allowing them to opt out of unpleasant tasks, ensuring fair compensation, and providing wellness support. For sensitive content, technical features like blurring or grayscale were used, and project categories were clearly delineated to avoid surprises (Document 1).\n\n**2. System-Level Mitigations:**\n- **User Interface and Monitoring:** OpenAI applied best practices in the user interface to support users and monitored for violations of usage policies. This included improving internal safety systems to detect bad actors and reduce the risk of overreliance on the model (Document 1).\n- **Policy Enforcement:** System-level mitigations included monitoring and enforcing usage policies to prevent misuse (Document 2).\n\n**3. Evaluation and Expert Engagement:**\n- **Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluations:** OpenAI conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including engaging with domain experts to inform which automatic evaluations and mitigations would be most effective (Document 1).\n- **External Expert Engagement:** OpenAI involved external experts to help assess and improve safety processes (Document 2).\n\n**4. Limitations and Ongoing Challenges:**\n- While these mitigations improved safety, OpenAI acknowledges that they are not perfect and remain brittle in some cases. The majority of safety measures were designed and tested primarily in English and with a US-centric perspective, so their effectiveness in other languages and cultural contexts may be limited (Document 1, Document 2).\n\n**Summary Table of Safety Measures:**\n\n| Safety Measure                        | Description                                                                                 | Source         |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Dataset Filtering                      | Removal of inappropriate erotic content using classifiers and lexicon-based methods          | Document 1     |\n| RLHF                                   | Training with human feedback to shape safer model behavior                                  | Document 1     |\n| Annotator Guidelines                   | Worker protections, opt-out rights, wellness support, and technical content filtering       | Document 1     |\n| System-Level Monitoring                | User interface best practices and monitoring for policy violations                          | Document 1, 2  |\n| Policy Enforcement                     | Enforcement of usage policies to prevent misuse                                             | Document 2     |\n| Expert Engagement                      | Involvement of domain and external experts in evaluation and mitigation design              | Document 1, 2  |\n| Qualitative & Quantitative Evaluation  | Comprehensive testing and evaluation of model safety                                        | Document 1     |\n\n**In summary:**  \nOpenAI’s safety measures for GPT-4 included dataset filtering, RLHF, annotator protections, system-level monitoring and policy enforcement, and extensive evaluation with expert input.
